Detecting fake news with machine learning models.

ðŸ“°A task:ðŸ“°
There are a lot of fake news, so it is necessary to write an algorithm that can determine whether the news is real or not.
The accuracy of the algorithm must be at least 0.90.
I decided to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm in this task using the f1_score metric.
